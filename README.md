# AI Medical Intake Chatbot – Assignment

## Objective
Build a web-based AI chatbot that conversationally collects basic medical information from users, validates the inputs, and stores the data in an SQL database.

This assignment evaluates your ability to design a simple full-stack system with clean code, proper data handling, and a usable interface.

---

## Task Overview
You are required to develop an AI chatbot that collects **basic medical information**, including but not limited to:

- Name  
- Age  
- Blood Group  
- Weight  
- Any other medically relevant details you consider necessary  

The chatbot should ask questions conversationally, validate user inputs, and store the collected information persistently.

---

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Web-based interface  
- Any framework or library is allowed (React, Vue, plain HTML/CSS/JS, etc.)

### Backend
- Must be implemented in **Python**
- You may use any backend framework (Flask, FastAPI, Django, etc.)

### Database
- Use an **SQL database**
- Examples: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL

### Functionality
- Conversational flow for collecting data
- Input validation (e.g., age must be numeric, valid blood group, etc.)
- Store user responses in the database
- Ability to retrieve stored data if needed

---

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated based on:

- Code quality and project structure
- Scalability and adherence to best practices
- User experience and clarity of interaction
- Correct and efficient data storage
- Handling of edge cases
- Any meaningful additional features you include

---

## Deliverables
1. Working application (frontend + backend)
2. SQL database integration
3. Updated `README.md` containing:
   - Setup instructions
   - How to run the project
   - Brief explanation of your approach

---

## Submission Instructions
1. Fork this repository
2. Implement your solution
3. Commit your code regularly
4. Update the README with your implementation details

---

## Notes
- Focus on correctness and clarity over unnecessary complexity
- External APIs, libraries, or AI tools are allowed
- This is **not** a production medical system — treat it as a technical exercise

---

Good luck.
